"""composite index on users(referred_by_id, has_made_first_topup)

The tiered partner commission policy (commit 4b48d519) introduced
``get_paid_referrals_count(referrer_id)``, which executes

    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
    WHERE referred_by_id = $1 AND has_made_first_topup = true

on every referral commission calculation — i.e. on every paying
referral's top-up. The pre-existing single-column index on
``users.referred_by_id`` is selective enough for partners with a handful
of referrals, but for partners with thousands of referrals (campaign
landings, KOL bots) PostgreSQL has to fetch each row and re-filter on
``has_made_first_topup``.

A composite index lets the query plan as an index-only scan and keeps
tier selection O(log N) in referral count.

``CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`` is used so the migration does not take an
``ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`` lock on ``users`` during the index build — matches
the repo convention established by migrations 0041, 0042, 0043, 0048,
0080, 0081 for any index on ``users`` or other large tables.
``CONCURRENTLY`` requires running outside a transaction, hence the
``autocommit_block()``. On SQLite (used in dev/CI) ``CONCURRENTLY`` is
not supported, so the migration falls back to the standard
``create_index`` path there.
